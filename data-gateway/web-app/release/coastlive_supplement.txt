	The Coast Live! app has significant business potential.  For instance, users 
	could be allowed to purchase songs and other band/artist merchandise directly 
	within the app, on the event details screen.  Or event tickets could be sold 
	in the same way, with a potential to earn a commission from the actual ticket 
	vendor on each sale.  
	
	Further possibilities include selling premium content subscriptions to venues 
	to allow them have more control over how their venue details are presented within
	the app and/or to enable bits of UI flair to make their venue stand out from 
	others.  This would in principle be similar to how Google allows businesses to 
	have their content promoted above other search results.  
	
	There's also potential for enabling more advanced features, such as geofenced 
	promotions that are automatically triggered whenever an app user is near a 
	venue.  Or the ability for venues to push notifications to nearby application 
	users or to users who have marked their venue as a 'favorite' or attended their 
	events in the past.  
	
	Because the app keeps track of what artists, genres, and venues 
	a user is interested in, it could also provide venues the opportunity to 
	target different segments of users with tailored promos.  For instance, the 
	way you engage with someone whose only interest is Hardcore music may be different 
	from how you might try to woo someone who's interested in Country and Funk 
	instead.  The Coast Live! app makes that possible.
	
	Even in its current form, the app promises to benefit local businesses by 
	increasing awareness (and therefore attendance) of local music events and 
	by reducing the amount of time and effort that venues must invest in 
	curating and promoting their events.  This reduces overhead for local 
	businesses, and increased attendence can translate directly into increased 
	ticket sales, which boosts revenue for both the venue and the artist(s).
	
	As a real, fully-working Android-native app, Coast Live! is ready for growth 
	today!
	
	
Category:  Community
	A thriving local music scene is an asset for any community, and the Coast Live! 
	app helps to keep the local music scene healthy and happy.  For instance, there 
	have been many occasions on which I realized that a band that I would have loved 
	to see has played a show (or several) on the Coast...some days or weeks after 
	the event has already occurred.  The relative lack of advertising/promotion of
	live events coupled with the absence of any single canonical source of event 
	information on the Coast means that unless you're constantly scouring several 
	different websites and Facebook feeds for event info it's likely that you're 
	missing out on some great events.
	
	The Coast Live! app solves that problem, by collecting events from those several 
	different sources and providing them all in a single, easy-to-access package.  Further, 
	it also lets me nominate my favorite artists, genres, and venues, with the potential 
	to automatically notify of new events involving any of my favorite bands, genres, 
	and/or places, even if I'm not actively using the app at all.  This means that I never 
	have to worry about missing out on an awesome show again!
	
	And if fewer people are missing out on shows because they just plain don't know 
	about what's on, that means more people will be turning up at shows.  More people 
	turning up translates into more revenue from ticket sales, and also from ancillary 
	sources such as food/drink sales, and artist/band merchandise and album sales.  Which 
	keeps the venues happy, the starving artists fed, and generally helps ensure that the 
	local music scene continues to thrive.  Which is a huge positive for the community.  
	
	The Coast Live! app can also leverage social media to create even greater awareness 
	and community engagement around the Coast's live music scene.  If regular concert-goers 
	are sharing events on Facebook and announcing which concerts they plan on attending to 
	the world, other people who might attend events more casually may take notice and decide 
	to go and see what's up.  This helps the music scene grow, and allows the Coast Live! 
	app to reach even people who aren't actually using it!
